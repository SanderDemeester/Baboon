1. Expand bits 32-64 of the input to 48 bits.
2. XOR the expaneded rifht half of the input with the provided key.
3. Use the output of the XOR to look op eight entries in the s-box table and overwrite the input with these contends
4. Permutate this output according to a specific p-table
5. XOR this output with the let half of the input (bits 1-32) and swap sides so the XORed left half becomes the right half,
   the next round with perform the same operations but on the other half
